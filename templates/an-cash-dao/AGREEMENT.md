# Aragon Network Cash Agreement


## Section 0. Background

Aragon Network Cash is a sub-organization of the Aragon Network, governed as the Aragon Network is by Aragon Network Token (ANT) holders. Aragon Network Cash is set up to allow for relatively easy access to funding for low-cost community projects. Aragon Network Cash is best thought of as the “petty cash” account of the Aragon Network.

Any ANT holder may attempt to make changes to Aragon Network Cash as a direct action, without having to go through a vote. The enactment of the action will be delayed, and during this delay any other ANT holder will have the opportunity to review the action to ensure it is consistent with this Agreement. If the action is consistent with this Agreement, then it will proceed to be enacted.

This Agreement exists to enumerate the shared mission, values, and constraints that bind ANT holders in their collaborative effort to create value for each other using the Aragon Network Cash organization.


## Section 1. RFC 2119 compliance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


## Section 2. Immutable guidelines

The guidelines in this section SHALL NOT be amended. If any other guidelines in this Agreement conflict with these immutable guidelines, the immutable guidelines SHALL take priority for enforcement purposes.

These guidelines apply to all proposals submitted to the Aragon Network organization, either by vote or direct action.



1. Proposals MUST be governed by this Agreement, or a future version of this Agreement as modified within the bounds of the Agreement. This guideline cannot be changed. \

2. Disputes over a proposal relying on this Agreement MUST be resolved by Aragon Court. This guideline cannot be changed.
3. Proposals MUST NOT disproportionately benefit a majority of ANT holders voting on a proposal over the minority. This guideline cannot be changed. \

4. Proposals MUST NOT attempt to cast a vote using ANT held in the address of any versions of the Agent app installed on the Aragon Network Cash organization, or using ANT held in any Aragon Network Cash contract that fulfills similar functionality as the Agent app. This guideline cannot be changed. \

5. Proposals MUST NOT activate in Aragon Court any ANJ controlled by the Aragon Network Cash organization.


## Section 3. Mutable guidelines

The guidelines in this section MAY be amended.

These guidelines apply to all proposals put forth to the Aragon Network organization, either by vote or direct action.



1. Proposals MUST be consistent with the Aragon Manifesto. \

2. Proposals MUST be accompanied by an accurate American English-language Justification of the proposal. Typos in the Justification SHALL be allowed if they do not substantially alter the meaning of the proposal. This Justification MUST be referred to in the on-chain source code or transaction data of the proposal by the content-addressed location of the Justification on the public IPFS network, and the Justification MUST be accessible via the public IPFS network for as long as the proposal is open for voting and/or in effect. If a Justification becomes temporarily inaccessible via the public IPFS network, and its proposal is challenged under this guideline, then jurors SHOULD block the proposal if they have reason to believe the Justification was inaccessible at the time that the proposal was challenged. Alternatively, the Justification MAY be encoded directly into the on-chain source code or transaction data of the proposal so that the Justification remains human-readable and accessible as long as the Ethereum blockchain itself remains publicly available. The Justification MUST include the following information:
    1. The name(s) and/or username(s) of the author(s) of the proposal. The author(s) SHOULD be the primary point of contact for any questions or comments regarding the proposal.
    2. The author’s preferred contact method, in case anyone has questions or comments regarding the proposal.
    3. An accurate summary of the proposal in 280 characters or less.
    4. A rationale section detailing the author’s reason(s) for creating the proposal.
    5. An accurate, long-form description of what the proposal will do if enacted.
    6. A section acknowledging by title and author(s) any similar or related prior work known to the proposal author(s). \

3. Proposal Justifications MUST NOT contain directly or by direct link any Non-consensual Imagery (NCI), Child Abuse Imagery (CAI), malware, spyware, or material that is owned via Copyright by someone other than one of the proposal authors (unless use of said Copyright material is permitted by the Copyright owner or otherwise protected under Fair Use standards).

# Appendix. The Aragon Manifesto

![The Aragon Manifesto](../images/AGP-0/manifesto.jpg)

Version 1.0.1

_Version 1.0 of the Aragon Manifesto was originally published on the Aragon Project blog [here](https://blog.aragon.org/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03/)._

<p style="font-size:2.2rem;">
A pledge to fight for freedom
</p>

## **We believe the fate of humanity will be decided at the frontier of technological innovation.**

We will either see technology lead to a more free, open, and fair society or reinforce a global regime of centralized control, surveillance, and oppression. Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak.

The Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to [**fight for our freedom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjIWmiAidw).

However, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation.

We believe humankind **should use technology as a liberating tool** to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.

Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.

**Decentralized technologies provide users unparalleled power** to transact and interact with a level of security never seen before. Thanks to cryptography and economic incentives, users can now own truly sovereign assets, create fully sovereign entities, and build truly sovereign identities. They solidify freedoms that cannot be taken away, not even by actors with sizable resources. This tectonic shift requires a new method for organizing these sovereign individuals: **decentralized organizations.**

For the first time in history, thanks to blockchain technology and smart contracts, we can now create fully decentralized organizations, which are truly autonomous and unstoppable.

Decentralized organizations change our relationship with **governance**: from something that is imposed upon us by others, into something we choose to opt into. Where we are equally serving and served, rather than just serving.

Building tools to create and manage decentralized organizations will unleash a [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) of new governance forms, and the competition among them will raise the bar globally.

It will finally allow us to experiment with governance at the speed of software.

Instead of complaining about how badly incentives are set in the world and how poorly resources are allocated, we will have the power to create systems that better align incentives and distribute resources. This is the Enlightenment of the century.

Sovereign individuals will be able to freely express themselves and transact with each other **without any kind of intermediary** exercising their unjustified power and oppressing them.

This may be one of the most important revolutions humanity has ever faced. We need to be careful about how we go about it. Technology can be a double-edged sword. We need to explicitly set out **the values that Aragon stands for**, in order for our community to always **uphold and defend them**.

### **We are committed to building organizational forms that defend self-sovereignty — where a user can always exercise choice, either by participating or exiting.**

In today's world, our governing power over society's common goods is negligible.

Even for exercising small changes over your environment (your city, state or corporation), you might have to go through cumbersome and opaque bureaucratic processes.

This happens because the coordination costs were high in the old world. But now, thanks to the Internet and decentralized governance, we can, and must, engineer systems to empower the people's voice to their fullest potential.

Also, if you dislike those broken governance processes, **you cannot easily exit from them**. Some organizations own your identity (governments), some others own your data (Facebook), and some others even own the path for you to exit (borders), restricting your choice of leaving.

**We must build organizational structures that allow users to exit with minimal friction** if they fundamentally disagree with the governance of those structures.

### **We are committed to creating collaboration mechanisms in which violence is not only disincentivized, but impossible.**

Choices can only be made freely in the absence of coercion and extortion. **Systems should never use violence** as a means to incentivize or disincentivize human behavior.

With cryptonetworks, we can create environments where others cannot even tell where individuals are located or what they look like. We must make violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography.

### **We are committed to decentralizing power in order to dismantle unjustified power — which usually springs from centralization.**

Power has a natural tendency to reinforce itself and become corrupt. If power becomes centralized, it doesn't have to answer to anyone but itself. **Decentralizing power is essential** to minimize corruption over time.

We must strive to create systems in which a large number of diverse stakeholders have a say, in order for common goods to be responsibly governed by their communities.

### **We are committed to the creation of long-term value versus short-term profit — which, in turn, advances sustainability.**

We want these values to last. **We are in this for the long run.** In order to make lasting impact and disrupt existing power structures, **we must create systems that provide sustainable economic value to their participants.**

We must honor and encourage the communities that sustain Aragon itself, and we must do so by rewarding those who defend the values outlined in this manifesto.

### **We are committed to a world in which every person can participate in these new organizational structures.**

We seek to use technology to lift people from oppression. To be successful, **we must keep our products open, understandable, and easy to use** for everyone.
