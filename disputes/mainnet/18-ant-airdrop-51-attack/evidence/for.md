Summary: This proposal will distribute a pro rata dividend to all ANT holders who vote "yes" on this proposal.

Rationale: ANT holders have put in a lot of work to make the Aragon Network Cash DAO successful, now it is time for them to enjoy the fruits of their efforts!

Description: If approved, this proposal will use the full treasury balance of the Aragon Network Cash DAO to issue a pro rata dividend to all ANT holders who vote "yes" on this proposal. The proposal does this by transferring the full treasury balance (100 DAI) to a "dividend" smart contract. This smart contract will then enable ANT holders who vote "yes" on this proposal to withdraw a pro rata share of the dividend contract balance.
