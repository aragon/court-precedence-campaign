The justification for this proposal is not available via the public IPFS network.

Based on Aragon Network Cash Agreement guideline 3.2:

> This Justification MUST be referred to in the on-chain source code or transaction data of the proposal by the content-addressed location of the Justification on the public IPFS network, and the Justification MUST be accessible via the public IPFS network for as long as the proposal is open for voting and/or in effect. If a Justification becomes temporarily inaccessible via the public IPFS network, and its proposal is challenged under this guideline, then jurors SHOULD block the proposal if they have reason to believe the Justification was inaccessible at the time that the proposal was challenged. Alternatively, the Justification MAY be encoded directly into the on-chain source code or transaction data of the proposal so that the Justification remains human-readable and accessible as long as the Ethereum blockchain itself remains publicly available.

Proposed ruling: BLOCK
