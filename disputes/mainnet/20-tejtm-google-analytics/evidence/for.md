Summary: This proposal will fund the development of a Google Analytics integration in the Aragon client.

Rationale: Currently the Aragon client lacks any ability to track usage and measure conversion rates along important paths of the user journey. Without this information, Aragon developers are "flying blind" and basing priorities on the loudest users instead of solid data about what users are struggling with. A full-service, end-to-end integration with Google Analytics would provide Aragon developers with the data needed to make better-informed decisions about about features to prioritize, what parts of the client need redesigned, which UI copy needs revisiting, etc. Aragon developers will also be able to get a better view into how users navigate the client even when they are not actually making transactions, which could reveal unique insights into how often users are really using Aragon compared to simply analyzing on-chain metrics.

Description: This proposal transfers 100 DAI from the Aragon Network Cash DAO to the address `0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA` to fund the development of a Google Analytics integration in the Aragon client.
