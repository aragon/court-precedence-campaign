This proposal provides funding for an integration with Google Analytics, a tool that feeds data into a global mass surveillance system owned by Google. For further information about Google's connection to mass surveillance see this article about recent complaints filed by privacy group noyb against multiple companies due to mass surveillance concerns about using Google Analytics:

Based on Aragon Network Cash Agreement guideline 3.1:

> Proposals MUST be consistent with the Aragon Manifesto.

And the referenced Aragon Manifesto which states:

> **We believe the fate of humanity will be decided at the frontier of technological innovation.**

We will either see technology lead to a more free, open, and fair society or reinforce a global regime of centralized control, surveillance, and oppression. Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak.

The Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to **[fight for our freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjIWmiAidw)**.

However, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation.

We believe humankind **should use technology as a liberating tool** to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.

Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.

Proposed ruling: BLOCK
