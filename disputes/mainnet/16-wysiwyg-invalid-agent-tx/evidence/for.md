Summary: Transfers control of the `ancash.eth` ENS name from one of our Agent addresses to our other AN Cash Agent address.

Rationale: We decided to use the Aragon Association multisig address `0xcafe1a77e84698c83ca8931f54a755176ef75f2c` to hold all of our ENS names.

Description: If approved, this proposal will transfer the controller of the `ancash.eth` ENS name from AN Cash Agent address `0x6afa5f5920fcc8d041b515253c2dc42ba4e5e588` to the Aragon Association multisig address `0xcafe1a77e84698c83ca8931f54a755176ef75f2c`.
