The proposal Justification says:

> Transfers control of the ancash.eth ENS name from one of our Agent addresses to our other AN Cash Agent address.

However the Aragon Network Cash dashboard shows shows:

> Execute 'Set 0xcafe1a77e84698c83ca8931f54a755176ef75f2c as the new owner of the 0xf53beeaf48eab5b3405783e3c4716a3849a670d8c178947abb5741a828cf079d node' on 0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e.

Given guideline 3.2 of the Aragon Network Cash Agreement:

> Proposals MUST be accompanied by an accurate American English-language Justification of the proposal.

Proposed ruling: BLOCK
