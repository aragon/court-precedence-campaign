The proposal Justification says:

> Transfers control of the ancash.eth ENS name from one of our Agent addresses to our other AN Cash Agent address.

However the Aragon Network Cash dashboard shows shows:

> Execute 'Set 0x87F4Dc77707CdbEDd0069C3CFC1b96f1725f03E0 as the new owner of the 0xb237995b885a9481dbf396f13a029055e9f38fb8aaf2527a55062c02c800e93f node' on 0x98Df287B6C145399Aaa709692c8D308357bC085D.

Given guideline 3.2 of the Aragon Network Cash Agreement:

> Proposals MUST be accompanied by an accurate American English-language Justification of the proposal.

Proposed ruling: BLOCK
