The proposal Justification says:

> If approved, this proposal will result in two changes to the Aragon Network Cash organization. 1. The Rewards app will be installed on the organization. 2. All permissions on the Rewards app will be granted to and managed by the Voting app of the Aragon Network Cash organization.

However the blockchain data shows:

> ACL: Create a new permission granting `0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111` the ability to perform actions of role “Create a new reward” on “Rewards” (setting `0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111` as the permission manager)

`0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111` is NOT the address of the Voting app.

Given guideline 3.2 of the Aragon Network Cash Agreement:

> Proposals MUST be accompanied by an accurate American English-language Justification of the proposal.

Proposed ruling: BLOCK
