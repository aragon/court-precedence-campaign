Summary: This proposal will initialize the `Execute actions` permission on the Agent app, assign the Manager role to the Voting app, and assign the permission itself to the Tokens app.

Rationale: The `Execute actions` permission is not currently initialized, and it would be useful to initialize this permission in case we need to use it.

Description: If approved, this proposal will initialize the `Execute actions` permission on the Agent app `0xf46ac50c67e77bc5cdddef0e323963b6f0aeade8`, with the Manager role assigned to the Voting app address `0xbd0a73248d45f198a841991b438c6057c8ba92a1` so that all permission changes have to be put to a vote, and the `Execute actions` permission itself assigned to the Tokens app address `0xbc7ad601dcc8430aa58afd4ef753cd71fce01ac7` so that all tokenholders can execute actions using the Agent app.
