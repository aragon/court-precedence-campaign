The proposal Justification says:

- If approved, this proposal will transfer 100 DAI to the Aragon Association multisig address `0xcafe1a77e84698c83ca8931f54a755176ef75f2c`.

However the blockchain data shows:

- Finance: Create a new payment of 100 DAI to `0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111`.

The recipient address `0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111` is different than the recipient address `0xcafe1a77e84698c83ca8931f54a755176ef75f2c` specified in the Justification.

Given guideline 3.2 of the Aragon Network Cash Agreement:

- Proposals MUST be accompanied by an accurate American English-language Justification of the proposal.

This proposal should be ruled "BLOCK" by Aragon Court.
