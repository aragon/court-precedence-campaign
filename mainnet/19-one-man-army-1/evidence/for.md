Summary: Fund the development of reimplementing the Aragon client for the Shadowlands platform.

Rationale: The Aragon client is great, but what about people who never leave their terminal? Having a Shadowlands-based version of the Aragon client will expand the user base of Aragon to people who like nice GUIs but feel more comfortable using a terminal-based interface.

Description: If approved, this proposal will transfer the full balance of the Aragon Network Cash treasury (100 DAI) to `0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA` to fund the development of a reimplementation of the Aragon client for [Shadowlands](https://github.com/kayagoban/shadowlands). This reimplementation will be released under an MIT license.
