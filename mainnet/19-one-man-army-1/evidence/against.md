This proposal spends the entire treasury of Aragon Network Cash on a single proposal. Even though the proposal sounds like a cool idea I believe the author will disproportionately benefit by taking such a large proportion of the available funding from the Aragon Network Cash DAO.

Based on Aragon Network Cash Agreement guideline 2.3:

> Proposals MUST NOT disproportionately benefit a majority of ANT holders voting on a proposal over the minority.

Proposed ruling: BLOCK
