The Token Balance Oracle app is an ACL Oracle. ACL Oracles are small helper functions that plug in to Aragonâ€™s access control list (ACL) to do more sophisticated permission evaluation. In the context of Dandelion Orgs, the Token Balance Oracle is used to check if an address holds Dandelion Org tokens and is thus a member of the organization. This is done by setting a minimum required balance in the Token Balance Oracle. Then when an account submits the intent to perform an action on an Aragon app function whose ROLE is protected behind this Oracle, the ACL will check with the Oracle if the account has the minimum balance of tokens required. The Token Balance Oracle will return a boolean which can be used to either approve or reject the intent.
