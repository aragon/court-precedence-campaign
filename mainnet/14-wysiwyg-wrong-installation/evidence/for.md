Summary: Installs the Rewards app with control over all permissions granted to and managed by the Voting app of the Aragon Network Cash organization.

Rationale: If the Aragon Network Cash organization ends up earning income from its investments, it would be nice to have a convenient way to distribute pro rata rewards to ANT holders. The Rewards app makes this easy to do.

Description: If approved, this proposal will result in two changes to the Aragon Network Cash organization. 1. The Rewards app will be installed on the organization. 2. All permissions on the Rewards app will be granted to and managed by the Voting app of the Aragon Network Cash organization. As configured, all new reward proposals will have to go through a vote by ANT holders using the Voting app of the Aragon Network Cash organization.
